# Routes

This directory contains the route configuration for the application. It defines how URLs map to the page components.

Examples:
- `index.js` or `AppRoutes.jsx`: This file would typically use `react-router-dom` to define routes, including public routes, private/protected routes, and layouts.
- `routeConfig.js`: Could be a configuration file listing all routes.
- `ProtectedRoutes.jsx`: A component to handle logic for routes that require authentication.

Example structure within `AppRoutes.jsx`:
```jsx
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import LoginPage from '../pages/LoginPage';
import DashboardPage from '../pages/DashboardPage';
// ... other page imports

function AppRoutes() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/login" element={<LoginPage />} />
        <Route path="/dashboard" element={<DashboardPage />} />
        {/* Define other routes, including nested routes and protected routes */}
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

export default AppRoutes;
```
