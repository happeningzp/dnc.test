# Utils

This directory is for miscellaneous utility functions that can be reused across the application. These functions typically perform specific tasks and are not tied to a particular component or service.

Examples:
- `formatDate.js` (for date formatting)
- `localStorage.js` (for helper functions to interact with local storage, if not part of a hook)
- `validators.js` (for common validation functions, if not part of forms themselves)
- `constants.js` (for application-wide constants)
- `helpers.js` (for other general helper functions)
