# Hooks

This directory is for custom React hooks, which allow you to reuse stateful logic across components.

Examples:
- useAuth.js (custom hook for authentication status)
- useForm.js (custom hook for form handling)
- useFetch.js (custom hook for data fetching)
- useLocalStorage.js (custom hook for interacting with local storage)
